===========
_It's like foster care_
To install:
1. get a reasonable linux dev environment
2. install sugar-build (http://sugarlabs.org/~buildbot/docs/build.html)
3. install sugar-emulator and sugar-session (package names may vary from distro to disro)
4. sudo python setup.py install
5. run the emulator! (sugar-emulator -F for windowed mode)
6. see how shitty it looks!
