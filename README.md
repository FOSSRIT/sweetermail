===========
_It's like foster care_
To install:
- get a reasonable linux dev environment
- install sugar-build (http://sugarlabs.org/~buildbot/docs/build.html)
- install sugar-emulator and sugar-session (package names may vary from distro to disro)
- sudo python setup.py install
- run the emulator! (sugar-emulator -F for windowed mode)
- see how shitty it looks!
